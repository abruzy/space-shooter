<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is the basic start of a Space Shooter Game built with Phaser 3.

The project had a deadline of five days total. Two of those days were allocated to designing, preparing and learning, while the final three days were allocated to building the project.
### Built With
This progam was made using this technologies
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Language used.
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) - The Game Framework used.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Tool for bundling our code.

## Design Process

At the end of day two, I had learned the basics of PhaserJS, specifically, the physics and motion. There were several objectives I had when starting day three.

* MVP - Try to build the core functionality before dolling it up.
* Making sure that what I build is functional.
* Try to make the code scalable by focusing on building a system.
* The layout and look of the game can always change, but the functionality will become more difficult to alter over time.

## Choosing the Building Blocks

Given the limited timeframe, there was not a lot of flexiblity afforded to me here, so I ran with what I could. Luckily, I found great music, sprites, etc in a short amount of time.

The design process here was dependent on basic cohesion, in order to fit the deadline.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/abruzy/space-shooter
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

2. Next step is to change directory by doing this below
```
cd space-shooter
```

3. Next step is to install all the project dependencies by running this command below

```
npm install
```

4. Then, next step is to run this command:

NB: This will open a new tab on your browser where you will see the game.
```
npm run start
```
